# Kid-or-Adult
This is a deep learning model where i have used image recognition to distinguish if a person is a kid or an adult, i have created this model inspired by Jermey Howards fast.ai MOOC the model is based on pytorch and fastai

the code has all the comments which will be useful to understand the process on how the code works

this might need a GPU which you can rent for around 60 cents for an hour from various providers,I have used Google CoLab Cloud GPU for this experiment.
